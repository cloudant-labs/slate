Client libraries are the tools that let you develop your own applications to work with Cloudant databases.

The following client libraries are formally [supported](libraries.html#supported-client-libraries) by Cloudant.

-	[Mobile](libraries.html#mobile)
-	[Java](libraries.html#java)
-	[Node.js](libraries.html#node.js)
-	[Python](libraries.html#python)
-	[Objective C and Swift](libraries.html#objective-c-and-swift)


A supported library is one where you can contact Cloudant if you encounter a specific, reproducible problem in the latest version of the library.

Other client libraries have been created by [third parties](libraries.html#third-party-client-libraries) or are no longer officially supported.

<aside class="warning" role="complementary" aria-label="notmaintained">Third-party client libraries are not maintained or supported by Cloudant.
If you encounter a specific, reproducible problem with a third-party library,
you should contact the library maintainer for assistance.</aside> 

If a library for your preferred language is not available,
why not [let us know?](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/slate/issues)
