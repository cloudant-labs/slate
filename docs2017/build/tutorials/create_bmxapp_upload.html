  <h1 id="creating-a-simple-bluemix-application-to-access-a-cloudant-database-uploading-the-application">Creating a simple Bluemix application to access a Cloudant database: uploading the application</h1>
  <p class="shortdesc">This section of the tutorial describes how to upload an IBM&reg; Bluemix&reg; application.</p>
  <div id="uploading"></div>
  <h2 id="connecting-to-bluemix">Connecting to Bluemix</h2>
  <p>The first task is to connect to Bluemix.</p>
  <p>The <a href="create_bmxapp_appenv.html#toolkits">Bluemix toolkit</a> helps you to make the connection.</p>
  <p>Cloud Foundry needs to know the URL to use for making API calls, for example when you upload an application. The Bluemix toolkit uses the &#39;<code>cf api</code>&#39; command to manage the API endpoint. More information about the &#39;<code>cf api</code>&#39;
    command is
    <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/cfcommands/index.html#cf_api" target="_blank">available <img src="../images/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon" title="External link icon"></a>.</p>
  <p>Use the following command to tell Cloud Foundry the URL to use:</p>
  <pre class="pre"><code class="lang-sh hljs">bluemix api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
</code></pre>
  <p>Expect a result similar to the following output:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code class="hljs">Invoking &#39;cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net&#39;...

Setting api endpoint to https://api.ng.bluemix.net...
OK

API endpoint:   https://api.ng.bluemix.net
API version:    2.54.0
Not logged in. Use &#39;bluemix login&#39; to log in.
</code></pre>
  <p>Cloud Foundry now knows where to send API calls for managing applications.</p>
  <p>The next step is to log in to your Bluemix application environment. You must supply the following account details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your user name, which is specified as the &#39;<code>-u</code>&#39; parameter.</li>
    <li>Your organization name, which is specified as the &#39;<code>-o</code>&#39; parameter.</li>
    <li>Your space, which is specified as the &#39;<code>-s</code>&#39; parameter.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <strong>Note</strong>: The account details are available on your Bluemix dashboard, when you log in through a web browser, as shown in the following example:<br>
      <img src="images/img0035.png" alt="Finding your Bluemix account details"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Use a command similar to the following example to log in to your Bluemix application environment. Notice that you are asked to enter your account password.</p>
  <pre class="pre"><code class="lang-sh hljs">bluemix login -u Adrian.Warman@uk.ibm.com -o Adrian.Warman@uk.ibm.com <span class="hljs-_">-s</span> dev
</code></pre>
  <p>Expect a result similar to the following output:</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code class="hljs">Invoking &#39;cf login -u Adrian.Warman@uk.ibm.com -o Adrian.Warman@uk.ibm.com -s dev&#39;...

</code></pre>
  <h2 id="uploading-the-application">Uploading the application</h2>
  <p>The Cloudant Foundry toolkit now knows how to connect to the Bluemix environment.</p>
  <p>The next step is to upload the application itself. Details of a Bluemix application are provided in the <a href="create_bmxapp_appenv.html#manifest">manifest file</a>.</p>
  <p>The manifest file for the tutorial application was updated as described <a href="create_bmxapp_createapp.html#essential-files">here</a></p>
  <p>Use a command similar to the following example to log in to upload your Bluemix application.</p>
  <pre class="pre"><code class="lang-sh hljs">cf push <span class="hljs-string">"Cloudant Python"</span>
</code></pre>
  <p>A sequence of result messages is displayed.</p>
  <pre class="codeblock"><code class="hljs">Using manifest file /..../BMXDemo/manifest.yml

  <p>The Cloud Foundry toolkit located the manifest file, and is preparing to upload the application by using the connection and identification details you provided <a href="#uploading">earlier</a>.</p>

OK

App Cloudant Python was started using this command `python server.py`
</code></pre>
  <p>The application starts automatically. As part of the startup, a check is made to ensure that all requirements are met, by evaluating the contents of the <a href="create_bmxapp_appenv.html#requirements">requirements.txt file</a>. The application requires
    access to the Cloudant NoSQL DB library, which was <a href="create_bmxapp_createapp.html#essential-files">specified</a> when the application was created.</p>
  <p>After you upload and start the application, some simple system checks are run to confirm that the application is running correctly as far as Bluemix is concerned.</p>

  <h2 id="testing-the-sample-application">Testing the sample application</h2>
  <p>When the Bluemix Application environment was first created, the dashboard included a link in the <code>Route</code> column for the application:<br>
    <img src="images/img0017.png" alt="Screenshot showing dashboard for the application"></p>
  <p>Clicking the link opens a browser window, requesting some data from the application that is listening at the corresponding port. The application responds by returning the contents of the log file that was generated as the application was starting:<br>
    <img src="images/img0030.png" alt="Log file generated as the tutorial application started running"></p>
  <p>The contents of this log file are interesting. The start and end times are clearly displayed. In between, the log records each of the details as the connection information for the Cloudant NoSQL DB was retrieved. The actual values of the connection
    are not important. The log shows that the tutorial application was able to locate, retrieve, and use those values to create a new document in the Cloudant NoSQL DB database.</p>
  <h3 id="confirming-the-database-details">Confirming the database details</h3>
  <p>Start by opening the Cloudant NoSQL DB Dashboard. Click the <code>Launch</code> icon on the <code>Manage</code> tab of the Cloudant NoSQL DB service page:<br>
    <img src="images/img0036.png" alt="Launch icon on the Cloudant NoSQL DB service page"></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: To find your Cloudant NoSQL DB service page, refer to the details in the
      <a href="create_service.html#locating-your-service-credentials">&#39;Creating a Cloudant NoSQL DB instance&#39; tutorial</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When the dashboard opens, you can see that the application created the &#39;<code>databasedemo</code>&#39; database:<br>
    <img src="images/img0031.png" alt="The Cloudant NoSQL DB Dashboard showing the new database"></p>
  <p>The database contains a single document, created by the application. To verify the presence of the document, click the database name within the dashboard. A list of options for the database appears. When you select the <code>All documents</code> tab,
    details for a single document appear:<br>
    <img src="images/img0032.png" alt="A single document within the new database"></p>
  <p>To see the contents of the document, click the <code>Edit</code> icon, which appears as an image of a pencil:<br>
    <img src="images/img0033.png" alt="Details of the document"></p>
  <p>When the contents of the document appear, you can see each of the fields that were created by the tutorial application.<br>
    <img src="images/img0034.png" alt="The fields within the document"><br> In particular, the <code>rightNow</code> field has the date and time the document was created. This value corresponds to the time that was recorded within the
    <a href="#testing-the-sample-application">application log file</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="the-next-step">The next step</h2>
  <p>The next step in the tutorial is to <a href="create_bmxapp_maintain.html">operate and maintain the application</a>, for example when you start, stop, and debug the application.</p>
