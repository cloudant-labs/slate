  <h1 id="back-up-your-data">Back up your data</h1>
  <p class="shortdesc">To protect your business from data loss and corruption, you should backup your data.</p>
  <p>Two important principles help you avoid downtime and lost revenue:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Backup all your data regularly.</li>
    <li>Check the integrity of the backups.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can back up your data in Cloudant by using <a href="replication.html">replication</a> to make a copy of your database.</p>
  <p>But if your database is big, or you need backups for multiple points in time, having a complete copy of your database for each of the requirements can quickly result in significant disk usage.</p>
  <p>An alternative is to use the IBM Cloudant Incremental Backup feature. Incremental backups are a good solution for storing only the documents that have changed since the last backup.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <strong>Note</strong>: Daily incremental backup for Enterprise customers is currently a Beta capability. It is not enabled by default.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You can see more information about Incremental Backups in the topic <a href="../guides/backup-guide.html">Back up your data</a>.</p>
