# Single-node implementation requirements

In a single-node implementation, a database node and a load
balancer node are installed on a single node. This setup is only
recommended for trial testing and development.

If you use a single-node implementation for this purpose, a
single-core VM with 2 GB of RAM is sufficient to run the
product.

A single-node implementation is not recommended in a production
environment. However, if you use a single-node implementation in
a production environment, the requirements are the same as for a
database node.
