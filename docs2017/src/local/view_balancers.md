# Viewing the load balancer

Check that you can view the load balancer correctly.
{:shortdesc}

If you are using a properly signed certificate, or you accepted
an "untrusted" certificate, one of the following screens open.

*   If you specified `https://cloudantlocal.cloudant.com` or a
    similar URL, a load balancer welcome message opens, similar to
    the example.

*   If you specified a URL that includes the Dashboard component,
    `/dashboard.html`, the Cloudant&reg; Dashboard (or the Login screen
    for the dashboard) opens. This example shows the
    user-specified `dashboard.html` as part of the URL.
