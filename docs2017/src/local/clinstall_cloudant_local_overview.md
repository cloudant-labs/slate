# Overview

The IBM&reg; Cloudant&reg; Data Layer Local Edition (Cloudant Local)
version 1.1.0 includes some of the same robust, flexible features that
were originally only available in the Cloudant
Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offering.
{:shortdesc}

Since Cloudant Local version 1.1.0 is a new release, revision
tags do not mark new sections. See what's new for this release
[here](whats_new.html).

Cloudant DBaaS was the first data management solution to use the
availability, elasticity, and reach of the cloud to create a
global data delivery network (DDN). Cloudant enables applications
to scale larger and remain available to users wherever they are.
Now, those features are available to implement in your location.

You can complete the following tasks after you install Cloudant
Local.

*  Distribute readable and writable copies of data to multiple
   locations or devices.
*  Synchronize data continuously through filtered, multi-master
   replication.
*  Store data of any structure as self-describing JSON documents.
   Moreover, users can read from and write to the closest
   available data source.
*  Integrate with a RESTful API.
