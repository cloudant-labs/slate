After you install the third-party repositories on the offline system,
you can continue installing the database and load balancer node.
{:shortdesc}

1.  [Install the first database node](clinstall_install_first_db_node.html).

2.  [Install load balancer nodes](clinstall_install_load_balancer_nodes.html).

3.  Verify that the installation was successful by starting the
    Cloudant&reg; Dashboard that uses the load balancer node URL,
    `http://loadbalancer_url/dashboard.html`.
