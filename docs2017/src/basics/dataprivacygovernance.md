# Data Privacy and Governance

_(This Cloudant Data Privacy and Governance Update was originally published April 20, 2016.)_

As a pioneer in the provision of a fully managed and globally distributable Database-as-a-Service,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} allows customers to locate data in any
global SoftLayer or AWS region.
By providing customers with such high levels of data mobility to serve the local needs of customers,
IBM,
and Cloudant take data privacy and governance seriously.

To govern the movement of data from the EU to the US,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} complied with both US-EU and US-Swiss
[Safe Harbour Frameworks ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=29450){:new_window}.
Following the 2015 ruling of the European Court of Justice that
[invalidated ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=169195&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=113326){:new_window}
the Safe Harbour agreement,
IBM was quick to urge policymakers to work expediently
to ensure "[unbroken data flows between the European Union and the United States ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ibmgra/safe_harbor_10062015.html){:new_window}".

IBM prepared an EU Model Clauses agreement for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} customers
to facilitate the transfer of personal data outside of the EU
in accordance with the EU data privacy laws.
EU Model clauses are relevant to all customers
that send personal information about EU citizens to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

To request an EU Model Clauses agreement,
or for any other information or assistance around the transfer of personal data,
customers can contact the dedicated EU Model Clauses team at [eu-mc@ie.ibm.com ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](mailto:eu-mc@ie.ibm.com){:new_window}.

The EU Directive 95/46/EC sets out rules about the processing of customer's personal data.
As the data controller,
customers appoint IBM as a data processor to process any personal data that might be included in the customer's content.
In turn,
customers are responsible for obtaining all necessary consents
to include the content (including any personal data) in the IBM {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} solutions.

A list of countries where content might be held,
or from where content might be accessed,
for delivering and supporting a Cloud Service,
is available at:
[www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters){:new_window}.

More information about Cloudant's overall standards compliance can be found
[here](compliance.html).

-   [Amazon ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/){:new_window}
-   [SoftLayer ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.softlayer.com/compliance){:new_window}

Following the recent vote in favor of new
[General Data Protection Regulations ![External link icon](../images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.engadget.com/2016/04/14/eu-data-protection-rules/){:new_window},
Cloudant customers need to be aware not only of the Cloudant team's understanding and
compliance against emerging data privacy standards and legislation
but also of IBM's wider ability to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions
to assist businesses of all sizes with their own internal data governance requirements.

and how they are likely to impact your business,

and compliance efforts,
